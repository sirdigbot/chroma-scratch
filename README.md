# CHROMA
This is my Scratch project for Week 0 of CS50x 2021.
It's an asteroids-like game where you must dodge and destroy various shapes with different behaviours.  
You can only fire only bullet at a time--but you can *steer* it.

The game supports single-player, 2 player co-op and 2 player battle mode (1v1).
